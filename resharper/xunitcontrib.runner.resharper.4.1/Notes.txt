Debugging:

1. Ensure that xunitcontrib.runner.resharper.4.1.dll is not being loaded by Resharper
   (Simplest way is to delete existing file from C:\Program Files\JetBrains\ReSharper\v4.1\Bin\plugins)
2. In Properties/Debugging, set start program as C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe
3. Set arguments to ..\..\..\tests.sln /ReSharper.Plugin xunitcontrib.runner.resharper.4.1.dll
4. Leave working directory blank. By default it will be the bin\Debug directory

TODO:

Resharper + xunit - XunitFileExplorer

1. ProcessBeforeInterior - refactor to split into ProcessDeclaredElement
2. Either have ProcessTestClass add all test methods, or just have ProcessTestMethod add them - don't try and do both
3. Where does the output from the Theory tests come from?
4. Get Theory tests to display with parameter information
5. Get Theory tests to display as different to normal tests - multiple? different icon?
6. Nested test should display nested name? nunit doesn't
7. Nunit tests show reasons for skip + fail in tree view pane - we don't
8. IsUnitTestElement can return true for public methods with a [Fact] attribute but that aren't in a public class
	(affects solution wide analysis more visibly)
9. Split xunit tests into separate files with more distinct names



Resharper 4.5 debugging

1. Ensure that xunitcontrib.runner.resharper.4.5.dll is not being loaded by Resharper
   (Simplest way is to delete existing file from C:\Program Files\JetBrains\ReSharper\v4.5\Bin\plugins)
2. In Properties/Debugging, set start program as C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe
3. Set arguments to ..\..\..\tests.sln /RootSuffix ReSharper /ReSharper.Plugin xunitcontrib.runner.resharper.4.5.dll
4. Leave working directory blank. By default it will be the bin\Debug directory
