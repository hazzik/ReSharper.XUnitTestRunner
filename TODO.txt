TODO:

Resharper + xunit - XunitFileExplorer

1. Nested test should display nested name? 
2. Tests failing in fixture constructor should fail child tests
3. Look into filter usages - there's a filter for unit tests. How does it work?
4. InvalidFactMethod + AmbiguousMethodNames tests. Should these be marked as tests? xunit will run
 them, but will fail (if the xunit sdk identifies them as tests, we should display them as tests)
5. Fix up the manual tests. There's tons of them, tons of duplicated code and while there's a nice
 mix of x86/x64/anycpu, they're all .net 2.0 based. There are no .net 4 tests, and no vs2008 projects

6. How to support DisplayName?
7. How to support RunWith?
8. How to support traits/categories?
9. How to support Theory tests?
	a. Where does the output from the Theory tests come from?
	b. Get Theory tests to display with parameter information
	C. Get Theory tests to display as different to normal tests - multiple? different icon?


1. [FIXED]	Skipped tests not currently displayed in grey before run
2. [FIXED]	ConcreteBaseClass test doesn't include BaseTestMethod as child test
3. [FIXED]	DerivedFromAbstractBaseClass test doesn't run AbstractBaseTestMethod. Should it? Does xunit?
4. [FIXED]	Tests from base classes not currently being displayed correctly in test explorer (should display Base.TestMethod, but just displays TestMethod)
5. [FIXED]	Usage analysis is currently broken:
 		    a. Test classes are not marked as in use during Solution Wide Analysis
 			(includes parents of nested test classes, although this is the same with nunit)
 		    b. Properties used by PropertyDataAttribute are not marked as in use
 		    c. Non test methods (e.g. private methods marked with [Fact]) are incorrectly marked as in use
