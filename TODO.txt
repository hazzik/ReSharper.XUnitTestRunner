TODO:

Resharper + xunit - XunitFileExplorer

1. ProcessBeforeInterior - refactor to split into ProcessDeclaredElement
2. Either have ProcessTestClass add all test methods, or just have ProcessTestMethod add them - don't try and do both
3. Where does the output from the Theory tests come from?
4. Get Theory tests to display with parameter information
5. Get Theory tests to display as different to normal tests - multiple? different icon?
6. Nested test should display nested name? nunit doesn't
7. Nunit tests show reasons for skip + fail in tree view pane - we don't
8. IsUnitTestElement can return true for public methods with a [Fact] attribute but that aren't in a public class
	(affects solution wide analysis more visibly)
9. Split xunit tests into separate files with more distinct names
